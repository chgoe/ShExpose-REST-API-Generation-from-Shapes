# Evaluation

`batch_benchmark.py` is a benchmarking script that measures the performance of ShExpose's CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete) across different batch sizes. It runs requests against a local ShExpose instance and a SPARQL endpoint, collects timing statistics, and produces CSV reports and plots.

## Dependencies

- `httpx`
- `matplotlib`

## Results

The benchmark results are published at https://purl.org/shexpose/data.
